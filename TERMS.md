# Terms of Service for RainVu

**Last Updated:** October 15, 2025

By downloading, installing, or using the RainVu application ("the App"), you agree to be bound by
these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.

## 1. The App and Its Source Code

RainVu is an open-source project. The source code for the App is made available under the MIT
License, which grants you broad permissions to use, copy, modify, and distribute the source code.

These Terms, however, govern your use of the official, compiled version of the App as distributed
through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

## 2. Your Data

You are in complete control of your data.

* **Ownership:** You retain full ownership of all data you enter into the App, including rainfall
  entries and custom gauge names ("User Content").
* **Local Storage:** All User Content is stored exclusively on your device. We, the developers, do
  not have access to, collect, or store your User Content on any servers.
* **Responsibility for Backups:** Because your data is stored locally, you are solely responsible
  for creating and maintaining backups. We are not liable for any loss of data. The App provides an
  export feature to help you create your own backups.

## 3. Disclaimer of Warranty

The App is provided **"AS IS"** and **"AS AVAILABLE"**, without warranty of any kind, express or
implied. This includes, but is not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness
for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

The data, charts, and analytical insights provided by the App are for informational purposes only.
They are generated based on the data you provide and may contain inaccuracies. You should not
rely on this information for making financial, agricultural, business, or any other critical
decisions. We do not warrant that the App will meet your requirements or that its operation will be
uninterrupted or error-free.

## 4. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the developer of RainVu be
liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or
otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the App or the use or other dealings in the
App. This includes, but is not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data, or any other
commercial damages or losses.

## 5. Third-Party and Open Source Software

The App utilizes third-party services and open-source software.

* **Third-Party Services:** The App may use services like Google Firebase for optional, opt-in
  analytics and crash reporting. Your use of these features is subject to the terms and privacy
  policies of those third-party providers. Please see our Privacy Policy for more details.
* **Open Source Licenses:** The App is built using various open-source components. A list of these
  components and their respective licenses is available within the "Open Source Licenses" section of
  the App's settings.

## 6. Prohibited Conduct

You agree not to use the App for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited by these Terms. While the
MIT License grants you the right to modify the source code, you may not decompile or
reverse-engineer the official, compiled version of the App obtained from an official app store.

## 7. Termination

You may terminate this agreement at any time by uninstalling the App from your device.

Your rights under these Terms will terminate automatically without notice if you fail to comply with
any of its provisions.

## 8. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the commit history of our
public code repository. Your continued use of the App after any such changes constitutes your
acceptance of the new Terms.
