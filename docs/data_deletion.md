# RainVu Data Deletion Instructions

This page provides instructions on how to delete your data from the RainVu application, as required
by the Google Play Store.

RainVu is designed with privacy as a core principle. The app handles two distinct categories of
data, and the deletion process differs for each.

---

### 1. Personal Rainfall Data (Stored On Your Device)

**Types of Data:**

* All rainfall entries you have logged.
* All custom rain gauges you have created.
* All in-app preferences and settings.

This data is stored **exclusively on your device** and is never transmitted to us or any third
party. You have complete control and can delete it permanently at any time using one of the
following methods.

#### Method A: In-App Reset (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to delete all your personal data without removing the app itself.

1. Open the RainVu app.
2. Navigate to the **Settings** screen.
3. Scroll down to the "Danger Zone" section.
4. Tap on **Reset App**.
5. Confirm your choice in the dialog box.

**Result:** All of your rainfall entries, gauges, and settings will be immediately and permanently
deleted, returning the app to its initial state.

#### Method B: Uninstall the App

Uninstalling the RainVu application from your Android device will also delete all of its associated
data.

1. Find the RainVu app icon on your device's home screen or app drawer.
2. Press and hold the icon.
3. Select the **Uninstall** option.
4. Confirm the uninstallation.

**Result:** The app and all of its locally stored data will be permanently removed from your device.

### 2. Anonymous Diagnostic Data (Optional & Collected by Firebase)

**Types of Data:**

* Anonymous app interaction events (e.g., screen views).
* Anonymous crash logs and performance diagnostics.
* An anonymous installation ID for your app instance.

This data is only collected if you have **explicitly opted-in** within the app's settings or during 
onboarding. This data is fully anonymous and is not linked to you or your personal rainfall data in 
any way.

Because this data is anonymous and aggregated, it is not possible to delete specific historical
diagnostic records associated with your app installation. However, you have full control over its
collection:

1. Open the RainVu app and navigate to **Settings**.
2. Under the "Preferences" section, find the toggle for **Share Usage Data**.
3. **Turn off** this toggle.

**Result:** The app will immediately stop sending any new anonymous diagnostic and crash data to
Firebase.
