# Privacy Policy for RainWise

**Last Updated:** October 14, 2025

Thank you for using RainWise. As an open-source project, we believe in full transparency regarding
your privacy. This policy explains how information is collected, used, and handled within our
application. You are encouraged to inspect our source code to verify these practices for yourself.

Our core principle is to protect your privacy; the app is designed to be a private, on-device tool.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect a limited amount of information, which is categorized as follows:

### A. Information You Provide Directly

This is the data you create and manage within the app. It is stored **only on your device**, and we
do not have access to it. This can be verified by reviewing the public source code.

* **Rainfall Data:** This includes the rainfall amount, date, time, and the specific rain gauge you
  associate with each entry.
* **Gauge Data:** The names of the custom rain gauges you create.
* **App Preferences:** Your chosen settings, such as measurement units (mm/in), theme (
  light/dark/system), preferred hemisphere, and other in-app configurations.

### B. Information Collected Automatically (With Your Consent)

To help us improve RainWise, we use industry-standard services to collect anonymous data about app
usage and performance. **This data collection is disabled by default and is only enabled if you
explicitly opt-in** during onboarding or in the app's settings.

* **Usage Analytics (via Google Firebase Analytics):** We collect anonymized data about how you
  interact with the app, such as which features are used most frequently. This helps us understand
  what is valuable to our users so we can make improvements. We have configured this service to
  operate without using your device's advertising identifier.
* **Crash and Performance Data (via Google Firebase Crashlytics):** If the app crashes, we collect
  anonymous reports that include information about the device (e.g., model, OS version) and the
  state of the app at the time of the crash. This is essential for us to diagnose and fix bugs.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

* **To Provide Core Functionality:** Your rainfall and gauge data is used to power all the features
  of the app, such as displaying your logs and generating charts and insights.
* **To Improve the Application:** Anonymized usage analytics help us prioritize new features and
  enhance existing ones.
* **To Maintain and Stabilize the App:** Anonymized crash reports are crucial for identifying and
  fixing bugs, ensuring the app remains reliable.

## 3. Data Storage, Security, and Sharing

### A. Data Storage

Your personal rainfall data, gauge information, and preferences are stored in a local database on
your device. We do not transmit this data to our servers, nor do we have access to it.

### B. Device Backups

Your device's operating system (iOS or Android) may automatically back up the app's data as part of
its standard backup service (e.g., Apple iCloud Backup or Google Backup). This process is controlled
by you through your device settings and is governed by the privacy policy of Apple or Google.

### C. Third-Party Services

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal data. We share a limited amount of data with the
following third-party services only under specific circumstances:

* **Google (Firebase):** If you opt-in to share usage data, anonymized analytics and crash reports
  are sent to Google's Firebase platform. You can find more information
  in [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
* **Support Communications:** If you contact us for support via email, the contents of your email
  will be processed by our email service providers (ImprovMX and ProtonMail) to facilitate
  communication. To help us resolve your issue, the app may pre-fill the email draft with
  non-personal diagnostic information, such as the app version and build number.

### D. Scope of This Policy

This Privacy Policy applies only to the official version of RainWise distributed through the Apple
App Store and Google Play Store. It does not apply to any forks, modified versions, or third-party
builds of the application derived from our public source code.

## 4. Your Rights and Choices

You have full control over your data within RainWise.

* **Opt-In/Opt-Out of Data Sharing:** You can enable or disable the collection of anonymous
  analytics and crash data at any time from the app's Settings screen.
* **Data Portability:** You can export a complete copy of your rainfall and gauge data at any time
  using the "Export Data" feature in the app.
* **Data Deletion:** You can delete individual rainfall entries or gauges directly within the app.
  You can also delete all app data by using the "Reset App" function in Settings or by uninstalling
  the application from your device.

## 5. Children's Privacy

RainWise is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age
in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes to this policy will be reflected in the
commit history of our public code repository. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy
periodically for any changes.
